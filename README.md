Driver's consciousness level analysis using EEG signals


Abstract
Driver Fatigue is one of the main reasons for road accidents; About 30 percent of the accidents occur because of drivers' drowsiness. Therefore early detection of driver's drowsiness will be critical to prevent road accidents. Using biologic approaches such as EEG signals is the most valid method.
In this project, EEG signals from Physionet Databases are used. Butterworth bandpass filter is benefited to categorize data to 5 sub-frequency bands. Six features such as minimum, maximum, average, energy, and entropy of the signals are extracted. These features are utilized for training four classifier, SVM, kNN, DT, and NN. Finally, k-Fold Cross Validation is employed to evaluate the classifiers. Accuracy of decision tree classifier (DT) reaches 95.2% for detecting drowsiness from awereness.
